    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Instant Coffee Granules</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Hot Water</li>
      <li>Spoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a cup, take 1.5 teaspoons of instant coffee and 1.5 tablespoons sugar
        (or add as per taste).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 3 tablespoons hot boiling water. You can heat water in an electric
        kettle or in a small pan. ¼ cup of water can also be added if you prefer
        a slightly weaker coffee flavor.
      </li>
      <li>First mix the coffee and sugar with water.</li>
      <li>
        Then begin to stir briskly and beat coffee for 3 to 4 minutes. You can take a break after 1 to 2 minutes and then continue if your hands start aching. You can also feel free to use a milk frother here if you prefer!
      </li>
      <li>Beat the coffee till its color lightens and you see a frothy layer on top.</li>]
